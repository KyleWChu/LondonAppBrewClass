                    <h3>Consulting Intern</h3>
                    <p>During the summer of COVID-19 I helped process over 600,000 financial accounts (Payable on Death Accounts, Health Savings Accounts, and Trusts) as the result of past mergers and acquisitions for Truist Bank, the sixth largest commercial bank in the US, to achieve FDIC Part 370 copmliance. These accounts were illegible to Capco's optical character recognition systems, so a team of US interns and Capco India employees were tasked with processing and QAing the accounts in a tight time frame.</p>

                    <h3>Teaching Assistant</h3>
                    <p>At Girls Who Code I was on a teaching team of 4 at Pfizer's New York City world headquarters that was in charge of 40 highschool girls from the Tri-state area. I taught Scratch, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Arduino Robotics as well as assisted in daily lesson planning. At the end of the summer, I mentored two separate groups on capstone websites: a chatbot with an integrated weather API and a college admissions analytics program</p>
